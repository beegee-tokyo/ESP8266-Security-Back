This project uses an ESP8266 for an motion detection based alarm system.    
Parts used:    
 - ESP8266    
 - PIR motion sensor    
 - Relay for light    
 - Piezo alarm speaker taken from a window alarm system    
 - DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor    
The alarm system is part of my home control system.    
The alarm can be activated automatically by programmed on and off times or manually from a PC or Android tablet    
The light activation at night can be activated by a command over TCP connection    
The measured temperature and humidity is broadcasted to other devices in my home control system over UDP broadcasting    
There is an option to remote control a second light over WiFi
